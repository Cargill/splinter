//! Traits for defining a connection matrix.
//!
//! A connection matrix is a collection containing [`Connection`] items, which allows sending to
//! and receiving from those connections via a connection identifier.
//!
//! A connection matrix must implement the following operations:
//!
//!   - add: Add a connection to the connection matrix
//!   - remove: Remove a connection from the connection matrix
//!   - send: Send a message to a connection
//!   - recv: Receive a message from any ready connection in the connection matrix
//!
//! Traits are defined in a granular manner which matches how a connection matrix is used. For
//! example, lifecycle operations (add and remove) are performed in a different component than send
//! and receive, and are thus handled via a separate trait.
//!
//! [`Connection`]: ../trait.Connection.html
