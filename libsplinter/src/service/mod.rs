//!  Splinter services are a fundamental component of a Splinter network.  They provide the
//!  application-level business logic, abstracted above the underlying network and circuit layers.
//!  The Service API provides a framework for defining services from a Splinter perspective.
//!
//!  Splinter services are effectively message handlers.  They receive the bytes of a message and a
//!  context for the message (including the originating sender).  It is up to the service to parse
//!  the message bytes into the format desired.
//!
//!  A service is identified by an ID, which must be unique within a Splinter circuit.  It also
//!  provides a service type, which indicates what kinds of capabilities the service provides.
//!
//!  There may be more than one service of a given service type on a circuit, though each instance
//!  must continue to have a unique ID.
//!
//!  Services are started and stopped explicitly.  At these times, the service must either register
//!  (at start) or unregister (at stop) itself.  In splinter terms, these two operations connect
//!  and disconnect the service from a circuit, but the Service API keeps the service circuit-
//!  agnostic.
//!
//!  A stand-alone service implementation may be wrapped in a ServiceProcessor, which will manage
//!  lower-level messaging and networking needs to talk to applications that implement Splinter
//!  node capabilities, such as the Splinter daemon.
