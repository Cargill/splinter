//! Traits and functions related to shutting down components.

use crate::error::InternalError;

/// `ShutdownHandle` is a trait which defines an interface for shutting down components which have
/// threads. It may also be used on non-threaded components which require cleanup at the end of
/// their lifecycle.
///
/// Two functions are defined which correspond to a structured two-phase shutdown sequence. The
/// first is `signal_shutdown` which instructs a component to begin the process of shutting down.
/// The second is `wait_for_shutdown` which will wait for shutdown to be complete; this typically
/// involves joining threads.
///
/// If multiple components are being shutdown, call `signal_shutdown` on all componets that can
/// safely shutdown in parallel, then call `wait_for_shutdown` on all of the components. The length
/// of time spent shutting down will be approximately the time of the slowest component.
pub trait ShutdownHandle {
    /// Instructs the component to begin shutting down.
    ///
    /// For components with threads, this should break out of any loops and ready the threads for
    /// being joined.
    fn signal_shutdown(&mut self);

    /// Waits until the the component has completely shutdown.
    ///
    /// For components with threads, the threads should be joined during the call to
    /// `wait_for_shutdown`.
    fn wait_for_shutdown(self: Box<Self>) -> Result<(), InternalError>;
}

/// Calls `signal_shutdown` and `wait_for_shutdown` on the provided `ShutdownHandle`s.
///
/// Any errors which occur will be translated into an `InternalError`, and any source information
/// will be lost. Thus, robust implementations will prefer to implement a variant of this function
/// themselves. However, this simple version is extremely useful in situations such as testing.
pub fn shutdown(mut handles: Vec<Box<dyn ShutdownHandle>>) -> Result<(), InternalError> {
    for handle in handles.iter_mut() {
        handle.signal_shutdown();
