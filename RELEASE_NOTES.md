# Release Notes

## Changes in Splinter 0.4.2

### Highlights
* Splinter signing code has been removed and replaced with
  [cylinder](https://crates.io/crates/cylinder). This was required for
  updating to the new version of Sabre.
* Scabbard and Gameroom have been updated to use Sabre v0.7. This will allow
  sabre to handle 0.5, 0.6 and 1 family versions, making splinter 0.4 work with
  0.6.

### libsplinter
* Replaces the `libsplinter::signing` module with use of the `cylinder` crate.
  This change removes the `sawtooth-sdk` dependency as well as the
  `sawtooth-signing-compat` feature.
* Pin protobuf version to 2.18 due to deprecations in 2.19.

### splinter CLI
* Update CLI man page 'SEE ALSO' link to point the
  [Splinter website](https://www.splinter.dev/docs/0.4/)
* Update CLI signing code to use cylinder. Replaces the use of the
  `splinter::signing` module with the cylinder crate.

### scabbard
* Update scabbard to use cylinder. Replaces the use of the `splinter::signing`
  module with the cylinder.
* Update sabre version to 0.7.

### scabbard CLI
* Update CLI signing code to use cylinder. Replaces the use of the
  `splinter::signing` module with the cylinder.

### gameroom
* Update sabre version to 0.7.
* Replace the use of sawtooth-sdk with transact-sdk-javascript in the
  gameroom-app.

## Changes in Splinter 0.4.1

### Highlights

* Fixed a Splinter daemon connection bug in `tcp://` and `tcps://` transports
  which crashed the listener thread if remote disconnects occurred during
  protocol negotiation.

* The `scabbard` CLI man pages are now available. Please see the
  [Splinter Website](https://www.splinter.dev/docs/0.4/references/cli/cli_command_reference.html#scabbard-cli)
  for more information.

### libsplinter

* Implement `Vec::from` for `ConnectionMatrixEnvelope`. Using `Vec::from` is
  cleaner than using the `ConnectionMatrixEnvelope::take_payload`.

* Remove the remaining deprecated `Network` structs. Several tests still relied
  on the old `Network` implementation. The tests were updated to use `Mesh` or
  the `peer` module so the deprecated structs could be removed.

*  Add `PeerManagerBuilder` to make creating a `PeerManger` easier and reduce
  errors by starting the background thread on build. The builder matches the
  pattern of the `ConnectionManagerBuilder`.

* Add `subscribe_sender`  to  `PeerManagerConnecter` which takes a `Sender<T> `
  which can be used to get a `PeerManagerNotification` and adds the ability to
  convert the notification to another type. This change updates the
  `PeerManager` to match the `ConnectionManager`. Also adds `unsubscribe` to
  the connector which allows a subscriber to no longer receive notifications.

* Add `ShutdownSignaler` for `PeerManger` and `PeerInterconnect` to match the
  `ConnectionManager`. The `ShutdownSignaler` is a more accurate name for the
  `ShutdownHandler`.

* Improve log messages around peer creation.

* Adds missing Rust API documentation to the peer module.

* Update frame negotiation to result in a handshake failure if the connection is
  terminated mid-negotiation when using TCP or TLS.

### Splinter daemon

* Update the daemon to use the `PeerMangerBuilder` and `ShutdownSignalers`.

* Update accept thread to log errors and continue instead of exiting on an
  `AcceptError`.

### scabbard CLI

*  Add man pages for all stable `scabbard` CLI commands

## Changes in Splinter 0.4.0

### Highlights

* The Splinter v0.4 release commits to API stability. Changes in future v0.4.x
  releases will be backward compatible with release v0.4, so that application
  developers can rely on the existing behavior and features of the Splinter
  APIs. For overview information, see [Splinter
  Releases](https://www.splinter.dev/releases/).

* This release includes all changes in 0.3.19.

### Splinter CLI

  * Add the SubcommandRequireOrHelp setting to all top-level subcommands that
  did not have the setting. This will display help text if the command does not
  include any of the child subcommands.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.19

### Highlights

* A stable 0-4 branch has been created for 0.4 pre-release work. Work on the 0.3
  release will continue on the 0-4 branch until a 0.4 release.

* The PeerManager can be configured to either panic or return an error if a
  non-existing peer reference is requested to be removed.

* The following subcommands of the scabbard CLI have been stabilized:
  - `contract list`
  - `contract show`
  - `contract upload`
  - `exec`
  - `ns create`
  - `ns delete`
  - `ns update`
  - `perm`
  - `cr create`
  - `cr delete`
  - `cr update`
  - `state root`

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The old `Network` struct has been replaced by the use of PeerManager and
  PeerInterconnect. The `Network` struct and the associated components are
  deprecated. They are now only available behind the `test` features and are no
  longer a part of the public API. Once all tests have been updated to not use
  `Network`, it will be removed.

### libsplinter

* Update the treatment of peers created by `add_unidentified_peer` to be the
  same as peers added with `add_peer`. This change allows automatic reconnection
  for peers that were added with the `splinterd` `--peers` CLI option or `peers`
  configuration setting.

* Improve the Rust API documentation for `splinter::peer`, including information
  for `PeerManager` and `PeerInterconnect`.

* Explicitly set the verify mode for `TLS transport`. The defaults are not
  always sufficient for rejecting a connection with a peer who has self-signed
  certificates. This commit sets the verify modes of the TLS transport to
  `SslVerifyMode::PEER` and `SslVerifyMode::FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT`. For more
  information see https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_verify.html

* Update `RefMap::remove_ref` to return an error instead of a panic if the
  reference has already been removed. This allows `PeerManager` to decide if it
  should panic if `RefMap::ref_remove` returns an error depending on the value
  of `strict_ref_count`.

* Improve the Rust API documentation for `splinter::collections::ref_map`.

### splinterd

 *  Add the  `SPLINTER_STRICT_REF_COUNT` environment variable to splinterd.
  Setting `SPLINTER_STRICT_REF_COUNT=true` while running `splinterd` will set
  `strict_ref_count` to true in the `PeerManager`. This will cause `splinterd`
  to panic if a non-existing peer reference is requested to be removed.

### Gameroom

* The gameroom docker-compose file that uses DockerHub images now uses 0.4-dev
  instead of master.

* Update the error handling in the Gameroom client to display the original error
  from the response.

### Miscellaneous

* Add files generated for the `/services/scabbard/cli` and
  `/services/scabbard/libscabbard` crates to the repository's `.gitignore` and
  `.dockerignore`.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.18

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The default network endpoint for `splinterd` now contains a TLS protocol
  prefix, `tcps://`. When starting `splinterd` with the `--no-tls` flag, a valid
  TCP endpoint must be provided (with the `network_endpoint` configuration
    setting or `--network-endpoint`  command option). Using the default network
    endpoint with the TLS protocol prefix will cause `splinterd` to fail.

* The `splinterd`  `service-endpoint` configuration setting and
  `service_endpoint` command option are now available only with the experimental
  `service-endpoint` feature. The command option and config setting no longer
  have an effect if the `service-endpoint` feature is not enabled.

* The `PeerManager` and its related components have been moved to the
  `splinter::peer` module.

For upgrade information, see
[Upgrading to Splinter 0.3.18 from Splinter 0.3.17](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-docs/blob/master/docs/upgrading/splinter-v0.3.18-from-v0.3.17.md).

### libsplinter

* Fix a bug where the Transact scheduler was not shut down if a transaction was
  invalid.

* Update the peer manager to handle the case where two peers connect to each
  other simultaneously.

* Fix a bug where a failure to authorize on peer reconnection would result in
  retrying authorization indefinitely. This failure now causes the connection to
  be removed.

* Update the peer manager to remove inbound connections for a peer when it is
  disconnected, then retry connecting to the peer's endpoints.

* Updated `GET /ws/admin/register/{type}` endpoint to check if the admin service
  is running before creating a websocket connection. If it is not running, the
  endpoint now returns a 503 service unavailable response.

* Add `on_reconnect` callback to `WebsocketClient` that is called before
  attempting to reconnect to a server.

* Move the peer manager from the `splinter::network::peer_manager` module to the
  `splinter::peer` module.

### splinterd

* Change the default service and network endpoints from TCP to TLS and require a
  valid TCP endpoint when using the `--no-tls` flag.

* Add the experimental `service-endpoint` feature and use it to guard the
  `--service-endpoint` CLI option and `service_endpoint` configuration setting.
  The option and setting no longer have an effect if the `service-endpoint`
  feature is not enabled.

* Remove the following features as compilation options so they are always
  compiled:
    - `config-command-line`
    - `config-default`
    - `config-env-var`
    - `config-toml`

### Splinter CLI

* Set crate dependencies to log level `Warn` to reduce noise in the logs.

### Scabbard

* Add the following to support checking a scabbard service's current state root
  hash:
    - `ScabbardState::current_state_root` method
    - `Scabbard::get_current_state_root` method
    - `GET /state_root` REST API endpoint
    - `ScabbardClient::get_current_state_root` method
    - `scabbard state root` CLI subcommand

### Gameroom

* Update gameroom application to wait for `/submit` response and display any
  error messages from the response.

* Update docker compose files to use static IP addresses for all containers.
  This fixes a bug where proxy IP addresses would become out-of-date when
  containers were restarted.

* Fix a bug that made it impossible to create new gamerooms after an instance of
  gameroomd reconnected to a previously restarted splinter node.

### Private Counter and Private XO

* Remove the Private Counter and Private XO example applications from the
  `splinter` repository. These applications are incomplete examples that were
  maintained primarily to test external services; external services are now
  considered experimental, so the applications are no longer needed.

### Miscellaneous

* Update several error and log messages to be more descriptive.


## Changes in Splinter 0.3.17

### Highlights

* Connection handling has been updated to use a dedicated connection manager,
  which provides consistent reconnection and heartbeat logic across both network
  and component connections.

* Peering is now performed at the networking layer, rather than by the admin
  service. The peer manager allows other components (such as the admin service)
  to request the creation of a peer; these requests are counted to make sure
  connections remain as long as needed. A peer interconnect component provides
  the capability for higher-level components to send messages to peers without
  directly interacting with the underlying connection layer.

* The Scabbard service, along with its client and other associated code, has
  been moved from the `splinter` crate to a new
  [`scabbard` crate](https://crates.io/crates/scabbard).

* The key registry and node registry have been merged into a single registry.
  All nodes in the registry now have a list of keys that is used by the admin
  service to verify circuit management permissions.

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The scabbard service is no longer provided by the `splinter` crate. The
  scabbard service and its client now belong to the `scabbard` crate.

* The names of several `splinterd` configuration settings and CLI options have
  changed. For more information, see the [`splinterd` section](#splinterd).

* Admin services now negotiate the protocol version after authorization. This
  change breaks compatibility between the 0.3.17 release and previous releases.

* The key registry has been removed. Its functionality has been replaced by a
  new `keys` entry for nodes in the Splinter registry. Registry configurations
  will need to be updated. (See the upgrade document, linked below, for more
  details.)

* The `/admin/nodes` endpoints have been moved to `/registry/nodes`.

* The Gameroom daemon (`gameroomd`) now uses Biome for user and credential
  management. There is a new "migrate database" step to correctly populate the
  Biome tables in the database. In addition, the Splinter nodes backing
  `gameroomd` need to be run with Biome enabled and must be connected to a
  database. Gameroom's docker-compose files have been updated to handle these
  changes. (See the upgrade document, linked below, for information on starting
  Gameroom manually.)

For upgrade information, see
[Upgrading to Splinter 0.3.17 from Splinter 0.3.16](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-docs/blob/master/docs/upgrading/splinter-v0.3.17-from-v0.3.16.md).

### libsplinter

* Remove the `matrix` feature as a compilation option. This code is now always
  compiled.

* Make the `service::rest_api` module public.

* Update circuit-definition serialization to include the node IDs.

* Make the `collections` module private to the `splinter` crate.

### Admin Service

* Update the admin service to log (but otherwise ignore) errors when restarting
  services.

* Add the `AdminKeyVerifier` trait (with an implementation for `RegistryReader`)
  for verifying proposal/vote permissions.

* Fix a bug in the service restart process that caused a deadlock in some
  scenarios.

* Add a `state_dir` argument to configure where the admin service stores files.

#### Splinter Registry

* Add the `registry` feature for optionally compiling the Splinter registry.

* Change the names of the following items:

  - Module `node_registry` is now `registry`
  - `NodeRegistryError` is now `RegistryError`
  - `NodeRegistryReader` is now `RegistryReader`
  - `NodeRegistryWriter` is now `RegistryWriter`
  - `RwNodeRegistry` is now `RwRegistry`
  - `LocalYamlNodeRegistry` is now `LocalYamlRegistry`
  - `RemoteYamlNodeRegistry` is now `RemoteYamlRegistry`
  - `UnifiedNodeRegistry` is now `UnifiedRegistry`

* Add methods for cloning an `RwRegistry` as a `Box<RegistryReader>` or
  `Box<RegistryWriter>`.

* Update `NodeIter` to be an `ExactSizeIterator`.

* Update `LocalYamlRegistry` to reload changes if its file is modified.

* Move `/admin/nodes` endpoints to `/registry/nodes` and introduce a
  `REGISTRY_PROTOCOL_VERSION` version number for `/registry` endpoints.

### splinterd

* Change the names of `splinterd` command options and configuration settings to
  be consistent.

  Configuration settings:
    - `admin_service_coordinator_timeout` is now `admin_timeout`
    - `bind` is now `rest_api_endpoint`
    - `heartbeat_interval` is now `heartbeat`
    - `registry_auto_refresh_interval` is now `registry_auto_refresh`
    - `registry_forced_refresh_interval` is now `registry_forced_refresh`

  Command options:
    - `--advertised-endpoint` is now `--advertised-endpoints`
    - `--bind` is now `--rest-api-endpoint`
    - `--network-endpoint` is now `--network-endpoints`
    - `--peer` is now `--peers`
    - `--registry` is now `--registries`

  For more information, see
  [Upgrading to Splinter 0.3.17 from Splinter 0.3.16](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-docs/blob/master/docs/upgrading/splinter-v0.3.17-from-v0.3.16.md).

* Add the `--config-dir` CLI option and `SPLINTER_CONFIG_DIR` environment
  variable for configuring the location of a `splinterd` configuration file to
  load.

* Allow the following TLS-related configuration settings and CLI options to use
  absolute or relative paths:
    - `tls_ca_file` and `--tls-ca-file`
    - `tls_client_cert` and `--tls-client-cert`
    - `tls_client_key` and `--tls-client-key`
    - `tls_server_cert` and `--tls-server-cert`
    - `tls_server_key` and `--tls-server-key`

* Move the `biome`, `biome-key-management`, and `biome-credentials` features
  from `experimental` to `default`.

* Fix a typo in the `--enable-biome` option that was causing the flag to never
  be set to true.

* Add a context string to the `UserError::IoError` variant to provide more
  details when one of these errors is encountered.

* Make the `node_id` configuration setting and CLI option (`--node-id`)
  optional, and provide a randomly generated default. An automatically generated
  node ID is an ‘n’ followed by a random five-digit number, such as `n12345`.

* Add a `SPLINTER_HOME` environment variable. When set, other directory
  configuration settings (or command options) do not need to be used to change
  the location of the TLS certificate directory, state directory, and config
  directory. This variable sets the following items:
    - `tls_cert_dir` is set to `$SPLINTER_HOME/certs`
    - `state_dir` is set to `$SPLINTER_HOME/data`
    - `config_dir` is set to `$SPLINTER_HOME/etc`

* Add a new `--state-dir` option to the `splinterd` CLI. This option configures
  the directory location of registry files if the `--storage` configuration
  option is set to `yaml`. The `--state-dir` CLI option overrides the default
  value (`/var/lib/splinter/`) and any value set by the `SPLINTER_STATE_DIR`
  environment variable.

### `splinter` CLI

* Add the `splinter registry build` command for constructing Splinter registry
  files. This command queries a `splinterd` `/status` endpoint for node
  information, then combines this information with user-specified public key
  files to add the node to a registry file.

* Move the  `database` and `database-migrate-biome` features from `experimental`
  to `default`.

### Scabbard

* Move the `client` feature (formerly the `scabbard-client` feature in
  `libsplinter`) from `experimental` to `stable`.

* Remove the `scabbard-get-state` feature as a compilation option. This
  functionality is now always enabled.

* Rename the scabbard client's `Error` struct to `ScabbardClientError`.

* Update the `ScabbardClient::submit` method to take `Duration` rather than a
  `u64` of seconds.

* Update the `ScabbardState::get_state_with_prefix` method to return an empty
  iterator when the prefix is not in state.

### Documentation

* Add man pages for the `splinter health` command and its subcommands.

* Make general improvements and corrections to the man pages and Rust API
  documentation.

### Gameroom

* Update the database creation and migration process to prevent migrations from
  running when not necessary.

* Run database migrations for gameroom tests to verify that the migrations are
  correct.

* Replace the key registry and static node registry file with a dynamically
  constructed registry file.

* Player names now appear in the UI as truncated public keys rather than
  user-friendly names. This is a side effect of removing the key registry; it
  will be addressed in a future release.

* Update both gameroom databases to preserve state across restarts with Docker
  volumes.

* Update `gameroomd` to use Biome for user registration and login.

### Private Counter and Private XO

* Remove registry files because they are no longer required by `splinterd` and
  are not needed for these example applications.

### Miscellaneous

* Update the Splinter justfile to run lint checks on all Splinter crates and
  exit on warnings.

* Add the Splinter logo to the Splinter repository's README.


## Changes in Splinter 0.3.16

### Highlights

* The Splinter daemon, `splinterd`, can be configured with multiple read-only
  node registry files (in YAML format). Specify registries with file paths
  (prefixed with `file://`) or HTTP(S) URLs (prefixed with `http://` or
  `https://`).

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The `--transport` option has been removed from the `splinterd` command. The
  `splinterd` `transport` configuration setting was also removed.

* The protocol prefix for TLS transport has been changed to `tcps://`. The old
  prefix, `tls://`, is still supported but is considered deprecated.

* The TLS options and configuration settings for `splinterd` are now prefixed
  with `tls`.

  Changed configuration settings:

    ```
    cert_dir  -> tls_cert_dir
    ca_cert -> tls_ca_file
    client_cert -> tls_client_cert
    client_key -> tls_client_key
    server_cert -> tls_server_cert
    server_key -> tls_server_key
    insecure -> tls_insecure
    ```

  Changed `splinterd` command options:

    ```
    --cert-dir  -> --tls-cert-dir
    --ca-file -> --tls-ca-file
    --client-cert -> --tls-client-cert
    --client-key -> --tls-client-key
    --server-cert -> --tls-server-cert
    --server-key -> --tls-server-key
    --insecure -> --tls-insecure
    ```

* A required `version` field has been added to all config objects. TOML
  configuration files should have a `version = 1` added at the beginning of the
  file.

* The `splinterd` configuration settings `registry_backend` and `registry_file`
  are no longer available. The related `splinterd` command options
  `--registry-backend` and `--registry-file` are also gone. Instead, use the
  `registries` configuration file setting or the `--registry` option with the
  `splinterd` command.

* Nodes may now have multiple network endpoints. The `splinterd` configuration
  setting `network_endpoint`, which was previously a single value, has been
  changed to `network_endpoints` and now takes an array of values. The
  `splinterd` command line option `--network-endpoint` remains the same, but can
  be specified multiple times. This change also affects node registry files,
  circuit proposals, and REST API responses; see the upgrade document below for
  more details.

For upgrade information, see
[Upgrading to Splinter 0.3.16 from Splinter 0.3.15](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-docs/blob/master/docs/upgrading/splinter-v0.3.16-from-v0.3.15.md).

### libsplinter

* Change the following features from experimental to stable. They can be enabled
  with the “stable” feature flag (instead of the “experimental” feature flag),
  in addition to being enabled individually. These features will be used by the
  default and stable Docker images published at
  [splintercommunity](https://hub.docker.com/u/splintercommunity).

    - `biome-key-management`
    - `biome-credentials`
    - `registry-remote`
    - `rest-api-cors`

* Remove the following features (no longer available as compilation options),
because the functionality is now available by default:

    - `node-registry-unified`

* Update the `Dispatcher` code:

    - Add `From` implementation for `ProtoConversionError` in the
    `dispatch_proto` module.  This will allow for uses of the various proto
    conversion traits to be used with the `?` operator in handlers.
    - Add a function to the `Handler` trait for `match_type`, which more tightly
    couples the message type to the handler.  This change greatly reduces the
    possibility that the handler and the type it is registered to could get out
    of sync.
    - Add a trait for message sending that can be coupled to the Source via
    generics.  A new module, `dispatch_peer`, implements this new trait
    specifically on `PeerId` for `NetworkMessageSender`, which supports the
    existing usages.

* Switch the dispatch `Handler` trait from using generics to using associated
  types.

* Add a new generic parameter on dispatcher-related structs, `Source`, that can
  be either `ConnectionId` or `PeerId`.  The generic type defaults to `PeerId`
  for backwards compatibility.

* Add a step to check if a request has method `OPTIONS` if `CORS` is enabled.

* Allow adding a NetworkMessageSender after a Dispatcher has been created.

* Add an optional whitelist to the RestApi object used to instantiate CORS
  middleware.

* Improve the `InprocTransport` `ConnectionRefused` error when there's no
  `Listener`.

* Improve the error message when a service cannot be initialized.

* Add the method `port_numbers` to `RestApiShutdownHandle`, which returns a list
  of ports that the REST API was bound to when it was created.

* Simplify the connection manager error implementation.

* Improve the node registry:

  - Remove the no-op node registry since it is no longer used.
  - Update node registry errors to match the standard pattern used elsewhere in
    Splinter.
  - Rename `YamlNodeRegistry` to `LocalYamlNodeRegistry` to prevent confusion
    with the `RemoteYamlNodeRegistry`.
  - Add the `RemoteYamlNodeRegistry` for reading node registry files over
    HTTP(S).
  - Improve node registry documentation.
  - Replace the `Node` constructor with the `NodeBuilder`
  - Add a newline to the end of local YAML node registry files.

* Switch two phase coordinator timeout from milliseconds to seconds.

#### Testing

* Re-enable two mesh tests

#### Biome

* Remove the use of concrete stores from the Biome REST API. This makes it
  possible to test `BiomeRestResourceManager`.

* Add a `CredentialsStore`, `RefreshTokenStore`, `UserStore`, and `KeyStore`
  implementation that uses `Arc<Mutex<HashMap>>>` to store objects in memory.

* Change the source field for `<store_error>::StorageError` to
  `Option<Box<dyn Error>>`. This makes it easier to handle cases where the
  underlying error isn't interesting or important to surface, or if the error
  doesn't implement the `Error` trait.

* Fix a bug in the route handler for `GET /biome/key/{public_key}`,
  `PATCH /biome/key/{public_key}` and `DELETE /biome/key/{public_key}`.

* Fix a performance issue when updating a user's password.

* Add initial unit tests for the Biome REST API.


### splinterd

* Update the response for splinterd's `GET /status` endpoint to include the
  node's list of network endpoints.

* Add the `advertised_endpoints` configuration setting and
  `--advertised-endpoints` command option to `splinterd`. This value is used to
  define the node's publicly accessible network endpoints if they differ from
  the node's bound network endpoints. The `advertised_endpoints` setting is
  exposed via `GET /status` REST API endpoint.

* Add the `display_name` configuration setting to `splinterd`. This value is
  used to give the node a human-readable name. The `display_name` setting is
  exposed via splinterd's  `GET /status` REST API endpoint.

* Update the `splinterd` `main` method to use the `Path` struct for building
  file paths.

* Remove the `--transport` option from the `splinterd` command.

* Add a required `version` field to all config objects and check that each
  config object added to the final `ConfigBuilder` object has the correct
  version

* Add support for './' and '../' in file paths for files necessary for
  `splinterd` configuration.

* Remove `registry_backend` and `registry_file` config options

* Add the configuration options `registries`, `registry_auto_refresh_interval`,
  and `registry_forced_refresh_interval`.

* Refactor the `splinterd` local registry location configuration.

### CLI

* Remove the `keygen` feature (no longer available as compilation option); the
  `splinter keygen` subcommand is now available by default.

* Add the long option `--url` to `splinter health status`.

### Documentation

* Add man pages for the following commands: `splinter`, `splinterd`,
  `splinter cert`, `splinter database`, and `splinter keygen`.

  To display a man page with the `man` command, use the dashed form of the name,
  where each space is replaced by a dash. For example, `man splinter-cert`.

### Gameroom

* Fix a non-deterministic failure in a gameroom integration test.

* Update code to support change to multiple endpoints for each node

* Add a database migration for the change from `endpoint` to `endpoints` for the
  `gameroom_member` table.

### Miscellaneous

* Add a justfile to support using `just` for simple cross-repo building,
  linting, and testing.
* Log a commit hash in the `splinter-dev` image.
* Add additional cleanup to the `splinter-dev` image.
* Update the `protoc-rust` dependency to version 2.14.


## Changes in Splinter 0.3.15

### Highlights

* Command name change: Use `splinter circuit propose` to propose a new circuit
  (instead of  `splinter circuit create`).
* The `splinter node alias` subcommands have been removed.
* Default values for the circuit management type and service type are now
  configurable with the environment variables `SPLINTER_CIRCUIT_MANAGEMENT_TYPE`
  and `SPLINTER_CIRCUIT_SERVICE_TYPE`.
* Biome routes for user keys no longer require a user ID.
* The splinterd REST API endpoints for reading and proposing circuits are now
  in the default compilation target. Previously, this functionality required
  the "experimental" feature flag during compilation.
* The "biome" and "postgres" features are now available with the "stable"
  feature flag (instead of "experimental") and will be included in the default
  and stable Docker images published at
  [splintercommunity](https://hub.docker.com/u/splintercommunity).
* There is a new [splinter-ui](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-ui)
  repository for Canopy and saplings.

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* Biome routes for user keys no longer require a user ID.
    - The endpoint `biome/users/{user_id}/keys` is now `biome/keys`
    - The endpoint `biome/user/{user_id}/keys/{public_key}` is now
      `biome/keys/{public_key}`
* The `splinter circuit create` subcommand is now `splinter circuit propose`.
* The `splinter node alias` subcommands have been removed. This functionality
  will be replaced by `splinter circuit template` subcommands in an upcoming
  release.

For upgrade information, see [Upgrading to Splinter 0.3.15 from Splinter 0.3.14](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-docs/blob/master/docs/upgrading/splinter-v0.3.15-from-v0.3.14.md).

### libsplinter

* Move the "biome" and "postgres" features from experimental to stable. They
  can be enabled with the “stable” feature flag (instead of the “experimental”
  feature flag), in addition to being enabled individually. These features
  will be used by the default and stable Docker images published at
  [splintercommunity](https://hub.docker.com/u/splintercommunity).
* Remove the following features (no longer available as compilation options),
  because the functionality is now available by default:
    - `biome-rest-api`
    - `circuit-read`
    - `proposal-read`
* Remove the following features (no longer available as compilation options):
    - `database` - Redundant; its functionality can be accessed with the
       "postgres" feature,
    - `json-web-tokens` - Deemed unnecessary, because using authorization tokens
       throughout the Biome REST API is always required,
* Clean up and expand the transport module:
    - Remove unused errors, PollError and StatusError, from the transport
      module.
    - Remove transport status enum.
    - Implement `Display` for transport errors.
* Refactor the database module:
    - Refactor the constructor for `ConnectionPool` to `ConnectionPool::new_pg`
      to support multiple backends.
    - Replace `database::DatabaseError` with `database::ConnectionError`
      because the only valid database errors were connection related.

#### Testing

* The REST API tests now shut down after the tests finish.

#### Biome

* Change two Biome routes so that the user ID is not required in the route. The
  user ID is now derived from the provided access token.
    - `biome/users/{USER-ID}/keys` has changed to to `biome/keys`
    - `biome/users/{USER-ID}/keys/{public_key}` has changed to
      `biome/keys/{public_key}`
* Add a "refresh_token"  feature to the list of experimental features. When
  this feature is enabled, `biome/login` now returns a refresh token. (Refresh
  tokens are sent to the `POST /biome/token` endpoint to generate new access
  tokens without having to collect credentials when the short-lived access
  tokens expire.) Also, Biome has a new endpoint, called `/biome/tokens`, that
  validates refresh tokens and returns a new access token to the API consumer.
* Add a `/biome/logout` route.
* Rename and update several Biome items:
    - `SplinterUserStore` is now `DieselUserStore`
    - `SplinterCredentialsStore` is now `DieselCredentialsStore`
    - `SplinterUser` is now `User`.
    - `UserCredentials` is now `Credentials`.
    - `CredentialsStore` trait method `get_usernames` is now `list_usernames`.
    - Remove the generic type definition from the `UserStore` trait and the
      `CredentialsStore` trait.
    - Add the `update_keys_and_password` method to `KeyStore` trait.
* Add the `new_key_pairs` field to the `PUT /biome/users/{user_id}` payload.
     ```
     {
       "username":"test@test1.com",
       "hashed_password":"Admin2193!",
       "new_password":"hello",
       "new_key_pairs":[{
           "display_name":"test",
           "encrypted_private_key":"<encryped_private_key>",
           "public_key":"<private_key>"
       }],
    }
    ```
* `BiomeRestResourceManager` now requires `CredentialsStore` to be created.

#### Protobuf

* Add `FromProto`, `FromNative`, `IntoBytes`, and `FromBytes` to the protobuf
  module.
* Add a `ViaProtocol` generic parameter to the `FromBytes` and `ToBytes` traits.
  This allows for auto-implementations of the types for implementers of
  FromNative and FromProto.
* Add a `splinter::protos::prelude` module.

### CLI

* Change the following features from "experimental" to "stable". They can now
  be enabled with the “stable” feature flag, in addition to being enabled
  directly, and will be used by the default and stable Docker images published
  at [splintercommunity](https://hub.docker.com/u/splintercommunity).
    - `database-migrate-biome`
    - `circuit`
* Remove the following feature (no longer available as compilation options):
    - `node-alias` - Replaced by the `circuit-template` feature
* Remove the `splinter node alias` subcommands `add`, `delete`, `list`, and
  `show`. This functionality will be replaced by the `splinter circuit template`
  subcommands in an upcoming release.
* Update `splinter circuit create` command to display the newly proposed
  circuit after it is submitted.
* Add the `--node-file` option to the `splinter circuit create` command. This
  option loads a list of nodes from a YAML file, either on the local file
  system or from a remote server with HTTP. You can use this option with (or
  instead of) the `--node` option. This option supports the Splinter node file
  types used by the node registry and the `splinter node alias` commands.
* Update the `CreateCircuitMessageBuilder::add_node` method (which is used by
  the `splinter circuit propose` command) to check for duplicate node IDs and
  endpoints. If a duplicate is detected, an error is returned to the user.
* Update the `splinter` CLI's `CreateCircuitMessageBuilder::add_service` method
  (which is used for adding services specified with the `--service` argument),
  to check for duplicate service IDs.
* Remove the `node-alias` feature (the `splinter node alias` subcommands) from
  the splinter CLI. This will be replaced by the `circuit-template` feature
  (`splinter circuit template` subcommands) .
* Simplify proposing a circuit with `splinter circuit propose` by automatically
  setting the circuit metadata.
* Update the `splinter circuit propose` command to check for duplicate service
  arguments and return an error if one is found.
* Remove the `splinter circuit default` subcommands and all associated code.
  Default values for the circuit management type and service type are now
  configurable with the environment variables `SPLINTER_CIRCUIT_MANAGEMENT_TYPE`
  and `SPLINTER_CIRCUIT_SERVICE_TYPE`. This change simplifies circuit creation
  and lets users set default values with environment variables.
* Change the `splinter circuit show` command to require a circuit ID as an
  argument.
* Increase the paging limit for `splinter circuit list` to 1000.

### Canopy

* Remove Canopy from the splinter repository and move it to
  https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-ui

### Documentation

* Add man pages for the `splinter circuit` subcommands and `splinter database migrate`.
  To display a man page with the `man` command, use the dashed form of the name,
  where each space is replaced by a dash.
    - `splinter-circuit`
    - `splinter-circuit-list`
    - `splinter-circuit-proposals`
    - `splinter-circuit-propose`
    - `splinter-circuit-show`
    - `splinter-circuit-template`
    - `splinter-circuit-template-arguments`
    - `splinter-circuit-template-list`
    - `splinter-circuit-template-show`
    - `splinter-circuit-vote`
    - `splinter-database-migrate`

### Miscellaneous

* Update the examples
  [private_counter](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter/tree/v0.3.15/examples/private_counter)
  and [private_xo](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter/tree/v0.3.15/examples/private_xo)
  to be compatible with Splinter version 0.3.15.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.14

### Highlights

* Service ID must now conform to a specific format (a 4-character base-62 string),
  which is enforced by the `SplinterServiceBuilder::build` method when provided
  and randomly generated if one is not.
* Circuit ID must now conform to a specific format (an 11-character string composed
  of two 5-character base-62 strings, joined with a `-`), which is enforced by the
  `CreateCircuitBuilder::build` method when provided and randomly generated if one is not.

### Deprecations

* `splinter::transport::raw` has been deprecated in favor of `splinter::socket::tcp`
* `splinter::transport::tls` has been deprecated in favor of `splinter::socket::tls`

### libsplinter:
* Reorganize the socket-based transports, raw (now renamed tcp) and TLS, under a
  `transport::socket` module.
* Rename `RawTransport` to `TcpTransport` to better reflect the underlying capability.
  Also rename the `socket::raw` module to `socket::tcp`.
* Add a `comments` field to the `Circuit` object to allow for human-readable comments.
* Save a disconnected connection in a `HashMap` to be returned in case the connection
  is removed again at a later time.
* Separate circuit and proposal REST API responses from the internal structs so
  the internal structures can change as needed without impacting the data exposed
  via the REST API.
* Add a `BiHashMap` to `Mesh` for a unique ID to the mesh ID.
* Allow `BiHashMap` look-ups with elements that implement the `Borrow` trait.
* Replace the `RecvError::InternalError` with a `Disconnected` error for accuracy.
* Experimental feature “circuit-template” (new): Implement `CircuitTemplateManager`
  with functionality to list and load available templates.
* For all experimental Biome features:
    - Remove Arc wrappings from Biome’s user store to allow mutable references of
      the user store.
    - Separate Biome models and schemas into their respective modules.
    - Add a `/biome/verify` REST API endpoint to verify a user’s password.
    - Update the Biome Rust API documentation to remove explicit references to
      Rust features.
    - Make the Biome user module private.
    - Rename `biome::datastore` to `biome::migrations` and add module-level
      documentation for biome migrations.
    - Remove all uses of `super` imports in Biome.
* Correct `json-web-tokens` feature guards.
* Experimental feature “proposal-read”:
    - Update the `ProposalStore::proposals` arguments to take a `ProposalFilter`
      enum to allow the proposal store to filter returned proposals.
    - Rename the `/admin/proposals` endpoint's `filter` query parameter to `management_type`.
    - Add `member` filter query parameter to the `GET /admin/proposals` REST API endpoint.

### CLI:
* Experimental feature “circuit”:
    - Update the `splinter circuit create` command to generate a service ID automatically.
    - Add a `comments` argument to the `splinter circuit create` command to optionally
      provide comment for the proposed circuit.
    - Display comments in the output of the `splinter proposals` command.
    - Update the `circuit-read` and `proposal-read` response deserializers to reflect
      the REST API response objects, rather than the related internal structs.
    - Add a `member` argument to the `splinter circuit proposals` command for
      filtering proposals by the given member.
    - Add `SPLINTER_REST_API_URL` environment variable to be used if `-U` or `--url`
      is not specified.
    - Remove the `required` specification from `splinter circuit list` and
      `splinter circuit proposals` arguments that are not actually required.
* Experimental feature “circuit-template” (new): Implement the experimental
  `circuit-template` feature. This feature lets you use a template to create a
   circuit with the new `template` subcommand for `splinter circuit create`.
    - Add the `dry_run` flag to the `circuit create` command, which displays the
      circuit definition without submitting the proposal.
    - Add subcommands behind the `circuit-template` feature to display circuit templates:
      `splinter circuit template list` and `splinter circuit template show`.

### packaging:
* Publish the Splinter package to crates.io when the repository is tagged.
* Add pandoc to the `splinter-dev` image.
* Update the version of `splinter-dev` to v2 and update Dockerfiles to use `splinter-dev:v2`.
* Experimental feature "circuit-template" (new): Include a `scabbard` template with
  the Splinter CLI and include the `gameroom` template with the gameroom daemon.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.13

### Highlights

* Breaking change: Socket-based transports (TCP and TLS) now require a version
  handshake when connecting.
* New experimental feature `circuit-template`: Circuit template library to
  simplify circuit creation.

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes

For upgrade information, see [Upgrading to Splinter 0.3.13 from
Splinter 0.3.12](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-docs/blob/master/docs/upgrading/splinter-v0.3.13-from-v0.3.12.md).

* Socket-based transports, such as TCP and TLS, require a version handshake when
  connecting. This handshake allows the pair to negotiate the header version for
  messages sent over the connection. The V1 header currently consists of a
  version, a payload length, and a header checksum.
* `TlsConnection::new` is deprecated. A `TlsConnection` should only be created
  via `TlsTransport`.

### libsplinter

* `RestApi::run` now returns a bind error if it fails to bind to an address.
  `RestApiServerError` has an additional variant, `BindError`.  Matching on
  specific errors will require a new statement for this variant, unless a
  catch-all statement is used.
* Experimental feature "circuit-template" (new): The circuit::template module
  provides library code for building tools to create circuits using templates.
* All experimental Biome features:
    - New OpenAPI documentation for REST API routes.
    - Improved Rust documentation; see
      [docs.rs/splinter](https://docs.rs/splinter/).
    - Restructured data stores to follow new model that enables future
      database selections.
* Experimental feature "biome-key-management": Added response bodies to the
  key management REST API routes.
* Experimental feature "biome-user":
  - Added response bodies to the user REST API routes.
  - Added `/biome/users/{user_id}/keys/{public_key}` endpoint, with both GET and
    DELETE handlers to fetch a specific user by public key and delete a user,
    respectively.
* Experimental feature “json-web-tokens” (new): Moved the sessions and secrets
  modules from behind the biome experimental feature to the REST API module,
  behind the “json-web-tokens” experimental feature
* Experimental feature "connection-manager":
    - Remove `CmResponse` from the Connector API in order to provide a more
      idiomatic Rust API.
    - Automatic reconnection for broken connections.

### CLI

* Experimental feature "circuit": The `splinter circuit create` subcommand now
  displays the circuit ID for a new circuit.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.12

### Highlights:
* REST APIs and clients are now versioned with a ProtocolVersion.
* OPTIONS/CORS is now supported by the splinterd REST API
* [CanopyJs](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-canopyjs) and [SaplingJS](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-saplingjs) have been moved to their own repos.
* The scabbard CLI now provides experimental list and show commands for uploaded
  smart contracts.
* The scabbard REST API now has an experimental get state route
* Numerous bug fixes and documentation improvements.

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes:
  For information on upgrading from 0.3.11 to 0.3.12 see [Upgrading](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-docs/blob/master/docs/upgrading/splinter-v0.3.12-from-v0.3.11.md) documentation
* Added “admin” prefix to circuits, key registry and node registry REST API
  routes.
* Rewrote the circuit create command so it does not accept a circuit definition
  in a YAML file, but rather it creates the circuit definition based on CLI
  arguments.
* Removed the deprecated generate-cert feature. Now you must use the `splinter
  cert generate` command to create development certificates and keys for using
  the TLS transport. See the how-to for [Generating Insecure Certificates for
  Development](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-docs/blob/master/docs/howto/generating_insecure_certificates_for_development.md) for more information.
* Changed `scabbard upload` command to `scabbard contract upload` and updated
  .scar file to be loaded by name and version from a specified `--path`
  argument.
* Updated the version of Sawtooth Sabre used by scabbard to v0.5.

### libsplinter:
* Add “admin” prefix to circuits route, key registry and node registry routes.
* Add optional protocol headers to REST APIs. The protocol guard looks for an
  optional header, SplinterProtocolVersion. If this is provided, it will return
  a BadRequest if the version provided is out of range.
* Add protocol guards to the Scabbard REST API endpoints
* Add protocol guards to the Admin service REST API endpoints
* Add protocol guards to the splinterd REST API endpoints
* Add protocol version guards to biome endpoints
* Add openapi documentation for the Biome routes.
* Wait full time in scabbard batch status check.
* Add a CircuitStore trait. This trait will be the external interface for access
  circuit information. This trait was also implemented for SplinterState
  directly.
* Update the circuit routes to use CircuitStore instead of an
  Arc<RwLock<SplinterState>> directly.
* Include node_id in circuit vote error message when the node is not allowed to
  vote for a node on the proposal.
* Validate the requestor's public key length when acting on a circuit proposal
  or vote in the AdminService.
* Reorganize the admin REST API and move circuit REST API into the
  admin::rest_api module.
* Improve shutdown of event reactor by removing the delay on shutdown caused by
  the event::Reactor using the combination of a running flag and reacting to
  that flag based on the, as well as signalling and joining shutdown in the
  same function (delaying other shutdown activities).
* Remove unwrap in libsplinter storage module. This error was propagated to the
  CLI and made debugging difficult.
* Add better documentation updates for circuit-read. Includes fixing the openapi
  documentation for the circuit routes, as well as adding rust doc comments to
  the route implementations.
* Add ServiceArgValidator and implement the trait for Scabbard. The admin
  services will now validate that a circuit proposal has valid service
  arguments, using the new, experimental, trait ServiceArgValidator.
* Add the CircuitFilter, for use as strongly-typed filter parameters to the
  circuits function on CircuitStore.
* Update the sawtooth, sawtooth-sdk, and transact dependencies to the latest
  versions.
* Remove sawtooth-sdk dependency from the scabbard client; it is no longer
  needed with updates to transact.
* Update the scabbard client's ServiceId struct to allow creating directly from
  circuit and service IDs, and to check that circuit and service ID are
  non-empty when parsing from a string.

### splinterd:
* Add a ClapPartialConfigBuilder object, used to construct a PartialConfig
  object from Clap argument values, available behind the `config-command-line`
  feature flag.
* Add a DefaultPartialConfigBuilder object, used to construct a PartialConfig
  object from default values, available behind the `config-default` feature
  flag.
* Add an EnvPartialConfigBuilder object, used to construct a PartialConfig
  object from configuration values defined as environment variables, available
  behind the `config-env-var` feature flag.
* Separate the TomlConfig object from the PartialConfigBuilder implementation as
  this object is now used to define the valid format for a configuration toml
  file.
* Renamed the previous PartialConfigBuilder implementation for the TomlConfig to
  TomlPartialConfigBuilder.
* Add the ConfigBuilder object, which takes in PartialConfigs and then
  constructs a Config object from the values set in the PartialConfig objects.
* Add the Config object; it is used to hold configuration variables compiled
  from several PartialConfig builder objects as well as the source of each
  respective value.
* Simplify logging for the Config object to display the raw configuration
  variables defined in the Config object.
* Added more robust logging for file operations, logging the fully qualified
  path of a file anytime a file is used.
* Remove the deprecated generate-cert feature. Now you must use the
  `splinter cert generate` command to create development certificates and keys
  for using the TLS transport.
* Clean up the main function in splinterd, specifically in how the Config
  objects are used.
* Handle OPTIONS and CORS Requests in splinterd. Respond to an HTTP OPTIONS
  request by returning all of the allowed methods. Also add support for
  handling CORS requests, guarded by a rust feature "rest-api-cors".  This
  checks the preflight conditions of the request, and fails the request if the
  preflight conditions are not met.


### splinter CLI:
* Update the output of the `circuit` and `proposal` subcommands to default to a
  human readable format.
* Add experimental `node alias` subcommand to save node information locally.
  This information can be used to simplify creating circuits.
* Add experimental `circuit default` commands to save local defaults for
  service-types and management type. This information can be used to simplify
  creating circuits.
* Rename keygen `--admin` to `--system` to better reflect the functionality of
  the flag, which is to generate keys for use by a splinter node.
* Send the ADMIN_PROTOCOL_VERSION with the SplinterProtocolVersion header when
  making admin client requests.
* Set the log level for low level crates to Warn to reduce the noise when using
  the cli with -vv
* Rewrite the circuit create command so it does not accept a circuit definition
  in a YAML file, but rather it creates the circuit definition based on CLI
  arguments.
* Add improved help text for `splinter cert generate`.

## scabbard CLI
* Add `GET /state` and `GET /state/{address}` endpoints for scabbard, behind the
  experimental `scabbard-get-state` feature.
* Add contract list/show subcommands to scabbard CLI. `scabbard list` will list
  the name, versions and owners of deployed contracts. `scabbard show` will
  print out the name version, inputs, outputs and who created the contract.
* Send the SCABBARD_PROTOCOL_VERSION with the SplinterProtocolVersion header
  when making scabbard client requests.
* Fix "execute" feature name in cfg's.
* Eliminate recursion in scabbard client's wait. Update the scabbard client's
  `wait_for_batches` function to use a loop rather than recursion to avoid stack
  overflows.
* Use new transaction/batch building pattern enabled by sabre/sawtooth/transact
  to simplify submitting transactions.
* Load .scar files using transact's new .scar file loading functionality; this
  changes the `contract upload` command to take a path and a contract
  name/version as arguments rather than a file path for the .scar file.

### health service:
* Add rest-api feature to Cargo toml. This fixes a bug where it could not build
  if built outside of the workspace.

### Gameroom:
* Fix games disappearing on refresh. Adds a check to ensure that games are not
  refreshed if selectedGameroom state is empty.
* Remove the vuex-module-decorators dependency, which was causing issues with
  debugging and provides little benefit.
* Implement a new component, Loading, which renders a spinner and a message
  supplied by a prop. This standardizes the approach to loading indicators
  throughout gameroom.
* Update the vuex page loading store to store a message.
* Trigger a loading indicator when pages are being lazy loaded or data has to be
  fetched before the page can fully load
* Update gameroom daemon to actix 2.0.
* Remove unnecessary Pike namespace permissions from setting up the XO contract
  in the gameroom daemon.
* Use new transaction/batch building pattern enabled by sabre/sawtooth/transact
  to simplify submitting transactions to scabbard.
* Update the Sabre version for transactions submitted by the gameroom web app to
  match the Sabre version used by scabbard (v0.5).

### Gameroom cli:
* Change gameroom cli version to match the rest of the repo

### Packaging:
* Add curl to the scabbard-cli docker image to enable fetching remote .scar
  files.
* Add scabbard to splinter-dev dockerfile

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.11

### Highlights:
* Splinter supports dynamic multi-party circuit creation in scenarios where the
peers are not connected when the circuit proposal is submitted.
* A new scabbard CLI provides experimental subcommands to submit batches of
transactions to a scabbard service.
* New experimental endpoints have been added to get state from a scabbard
service.
* Information on how to run the Gameroom demo using Kubernetes is available in
[docker/kubernetes/README.md](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter/blob/master/docker/kubernetes/README.md).


### libsplinter:
- Enable more than two-party circuit connection. The admin service now waits
for all nodes in the circuit proposal to be peered before handling a consensus
proposal.
- Add Biome (user management) routes for fetching, listing and deleting users
and updating credentials.
- Establish connection to peers when handling votes. If the connection between
nodes is dropped after a proposal is submitted, a node will try to re-establish
the connection before submitting the vote.
- Add support to configure the timeout value for two-phase commit.
- Set the default timeout for admin and scabbard services to 30 seconds.
- Add experimental endpoints (behind the "scabbard-get-state" feature) for
fetching and listing entries in scabbard state.

### splinterd:
- Replace the current Config object with a PartialConfig and a
PartialConfigBuilder. This is the first part of significantly refactoring how
the Splinter daemon is configured.
- Fix the panic caused by unwrapping a bad protobuf message

### Gameroom:
- Add example files and instructions (in docker/kubernetes) on how to run the
Gameroom demo using Kubernetes.

### scabbard CLI:
- Add the scabbard CLI with experimental subcommands that closely resemble
those of the sabre CLI in Sawtooth Sabre.

### splinter CLI:
- Add a keygen subcommand to generate a user's public/private key pair. This
subcommand uses the "keygen" experimental feature.

### Packaging:
- Update the libsplinter Cargo.toml file to include only experimental and
stable in the list of features in package.metadata.docs.rs.
- Add the Gameroom CLI to the splinter-dev docker image.
- Publish Docker images built with experimental features during nightly cron
builds.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.10

### libsplinter:
- Fix the wait for batch status in the ScabbardClient by adding the base URL if
  one is not provided.
- Add comments to ScabbardClient tests.

### splinterd:
- Add the CLI flag --enable-biome to the splinterd CLI.  The addition of this
  flag relaxes the requirement that the database-url option must be set.
  Currently, the database-url option is only required for the Biome subsystem.

### Gameroom:
- Add migrations for the Gameroom database to support upgrading an existing
  gameroom daemon.

### Gameroom CLI:
- Add gameroom CLI, which will initially be used to migrate the gameroom
  database.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.9

### Highlights:
* A Splinter crate is now available at https://crates.io/crates/splinter.
* The "splinter" CLI has new experimental subcommands:
  - splinter circuit create (create a circuit)
  - splinter circuit vote (vote on a circuit)
  - splinter circuit list (display a list of circuits)
  - splinter circuit proposals (display a list of circuit proposals)
  - splinter circuit show (display circuit and proposal details)

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes:
* The new node registry format is enforced as of release 0.3.8. Each entry in
  the node registry must specify a node ID, a display name, and an endpoint.

### libsplinter:
* Add experimental list and fetch routes for circuit proposals to the admin
  service REST API.
* Add key management routes to the Biome REST API, including POST, GET and
  PATCH  to /biome/users/{user_id}/keys.
* Fix Scabbard initial events by rejecting an empty last_seen_event query
  parameter and properly handling empty transaction receipt stores.
* Add a newline to key files generated by the splinter CLI.
* Start initial implementation of ScabbardClient, which provides a convenient
  way to submit batches to a scabbard instance.

### splinterd
* Add experimental Biome users API routes to splinterd.
* Add experimental list and fetch routes for circuit proposals to the admin
  service REST API.
* Log a debug message instead of a warning when the splinterd config file is
  not found.

### Gameroom
* Add a docker-compose file that uses published images. This compose file can be
  used along with the repository in situations where building from scratch is
  not feasible.
* Update the Gameroom README with CARGO_ARGS instructions for running with
  experimental features.

### Packaging
* Update splinterd packaging for the current node registry format.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.8

### Highlights:

* A new "experimental" feature set.  Features marked as experimental are
  available for use, but are subject to change.
* The “splinter-cli” command has been renamed to “splinter”.

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes:

* The Splinter CLI name has changed from “splinter-cli” to “splinter”.
  “splinter-cli” remains as an alias for “splinter”, but should be considered
  deprecated as of this release.
* The node registry trait was extensively updated to support iteration,
  implementation-agnostic filtering, and simplified modifications.

### Libsplinter:

* The protobuf files are now under the libsplinter subdirectory.  This enables
  publishing the "splinter" library crate.
* NodeRegistry::list_nodes now returns an iterator.
* NodeRegistry::update_node and add_node have been merged to
  NodeRegistry::insert.
* The REST API implementations for circuits, node registry, and key registry
  have moved from splinterd to libsplinter.
* A new "rest-api" stable feature includes the library functions mentioned
  above.
* New Biome features for user-related functionality such as credentials and key
  management. (Biome is the libsplinter module that supports user management.)
    - "biome"
    - "biome-credentials"
    - "biome-key-management"
    - "biome-notifications"
* A new "experimental" feature set that includes all experimental features.

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.7

### Highlights:
* The admin service and the scabbard service can now send catch-up events to
  bring new subscribers up to date

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes:
* The splinterd --generate-certs flag, which was deprecated in 0.3.6, is still
  available by default. In 0.3.8, the flag will not be available by default.
  Instead, you must use the Rust compile-time feature “generate-certs” to
  explicitly enable the deprecated --generate-certs flag. For more information,
  see the 0.3.6 release notes.
* In the next release, the splinter CLI name will change from “splinter-cli” to
  “splinter”. “splinter-cli” will exist as an alias for “splinter”, but should
  be considered deprecated as of release 0.3.8.

### libsplinter:
* Refactor the admin service and scabbard service to separate the REST API code
* Change admin service events to include a timestamp of when the event occurred
* Update the admin service to send all historical events that have occurred
  since a given timestamp when an app auth handler subscribes
* Update the scabbard event format to correlate directly with a transaction
  receipt
* Remove EventHistory from the REST API because it is no longer used
* Remove EventDealer from the REST API and replace it with the EventSender
* Update the event sender to send catch-up events as an asynchronous stream
* Add state-delta catch-up to the scabbard service, sending all events that
  occurred since a given event ID when a subscription request is received
* Update Network to properly clean up connections on disconnection

### splinterd:
* Fix the splinterd --heartbeat argument to properly accept a value

### Gameroom example:
* Update the gameroomd app auth handler to track the timestamp of the last-seen
  admin event
* Add the timestamp for the last-seen admin event to the app auth handler’s
  subscription request for getting any catch-up events
* Update the gameroom state-delta subscriber to track the ID of the last-seen
  scabbard event
* Add the ID of the last-seen scabbard event when subscribing to scabbard on
  restart, which lets the gameroom daemon receive catch-up events

### Private XO example:
* Replace the transact git repo dependency with a crates.io dependency

## Changes in Splinter 0.3.6

### Highlights:
* Peers can now successfully reconnect after restarting
* Faster build times:

  functionality that powers the Gameroom application; see
  examples/gameroom/README.md for a link to the PDF

### Deprecated Features:
* The --generate-certs flag for splinterd is now deprecated. Instead, please
  generate development certificates and keys using the new command "splinter-cli
  cert generate". This command will generate the certificates and keys in
  /etc/splinter/certs/ (by default) or in the specified directory.
  Note:  --generate-certs is still available by default in 0.3.6. It will be
  turned off in 0.3.7, but will still be available with a Rust compile-time
  feature flag. If using generated certificates, run splinterd with the
  --insecure flag.
