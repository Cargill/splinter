# Logging Options
#
# Appenders specify destinations for the logging messages. Each appender has a
# name, specified in the configuration section; for example the "foobar"
# appender would be in the [appenders.foobar] section. Each appender has a
# kind, which is one of: stdout, rolling_file.
#
# Multiple appenders can be specified. For example, if you want different log
# files to contain different level values (one log with just warnings, one with
# all debug, for example), you can specify multiple rolling file appenders.

# The stdout appender is the only default appender. Defining the stdout
# appender here will override the default appender settings. Note that the
# splinterd verbose option (-v, --verbose) will increase the logging level on
# this appender.
#
#[appenders.stdout]
#
# "kind" options are stdout,stderr,file,rolling_file
#kind = "stdout"
#
# Pattern controls the formatting of each log message.
#pattern = "[ {d(%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%.3f)}] T[{T}] {l} [{M}] {m}\n"

# The debuglog appender is an example of a rolling_file appender. It creates
# a log file with debug and higher messages.
#
#[appenders.debuglog]
#
#kind = "rolling_file"
#
# Pattern controls the formatting of each log message.
#pattern = "[ {d(%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%.3f)}] T[{T}] {l} [{M}] {m}\n"
#
# Filename is specific to rolling_file and file appenders and is simply a path
# to a file.  Must be specified.
#filename = "/var/log/splinter/splinterd-debug.log"
#
# Size is specific to rolling_file and specifies when the file should be
# rolled/overwritten.  Must be specified.
#size = "16.0M"
#
# Level on an appender specifies which messages should be sent to the appender;
# in this case, all messages level Debug or higher will be sent to the
# appender.
#level = "Debug"

# The warnlog appender is the same as the debuglog appender, but with a
# different level value. This appender can be used in combination with the
# debuglog appender.
#
#[appenders.warnlog]
#
#kind = "file"
#
# Pattern controls the formatting of each log message.
#pattern = "[ {d(%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%.3f)}] T[{T}] {l} [{M}] {m}\n"

# Filename is specific to rolling_file and file appenders and is simply a path
# to a file.  Must be specified.
#filename = "/var/log/splinter/splinterd-warn.log"
#
# All messages "Warn" and higher will be sent this appender.
#level = "Warn"

# The root logger ([loggers.root]) section specifies defaults for message
# generation.
#
#[loggers.root]
#
# By default, messages will be sent only to the "stdout" appender. Uncomment
# the second example to send messages to the appenders defined above (or add
# your own appenders here).
#appenders = [ "stdout"]
#appenders = [ "stdout", "debuglog", "warnlog"]
#
# This is the default level at which messages are generated. Messages are
# generated by loggers and filtered by appenders, which means if you want
# "Debug" messages to appear, you must set the level here to "Debug" (or lower)
# and also set the level for the appender to "Debug" (or lower).
#
# Valid options are, Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, and Error in decreasing order of
# verbosity.
#level = "Warn"

#
# Logging Options (Advanced)
#
# Loggers control the generation of messages and where they are sent. The name
# of the logger is derived from the code for which it controls. For example,
# "loggers.splinter" controls messages in the splinter (Splinter library) Rust
# crate; similarly, "loggers.splinterd" controls messages in the splinterd
# (Splinter daemon) Rust crate.

# Loggers form the connection between code and the appenders.
# By default there is a single "root" logger that logs to the "stdout" appender,
#[loggers.splinter]

# The appenders field is a list of defined appender names. It is optional for
# all non-root loggers and will inherit its parents appenders.
#appenders = [ "stdout", "rolling_file"]

# Level defines the level of log the logger writes to appenders.  Valid options
# are, Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, and Error in decreasing order of verbosity.
# Optional for non-root loggers, defaults to the root loggers level.
#level = "Warn"
#
# By default there are six non-root loggers configured. 
#
#[loggers.splinter]
#level = "Trace"
#
#[loggers.splinterd]
#level = "Trace"
#
#[loggers.scabbard]
#level = "Trace"
#
#[loggers.sawtooth]
#level = "Trace"
#
#[loggers.cylinder]
#level = "Trace"
#
#[loggers.transact]
#level = "Trace"
#
# These five loggers select for the logs related to Splinter operations. Their
# appenders fields are not set so they inherit their appenders from the root
# logger.
