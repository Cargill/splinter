NAME
====

**splinterd** â€” Starts the Splinter daemon

SYNOPSIS
========

**splinterd** \[**FLAGS**\] \[**OPTIONS**\] <arguments>

DESCRIPTION
===========

This command configures and runs the Splinter daemon, `splinterd`. This daemon
provides core Splinter functionality such as circuit management, a REST API,
and an admin service. It can also include application-specific services.

The `splinterd` command requires a new ID for the node. Other settings are
optional.

**Configuration File**

This command provides the `-c` and `--config` options to specify an optional
TOML configuration file containing `splinterd` settings, instead of using
command-line options. (Any options on the command line will override those in
the configuration file.) The file name must end with a `.toml` extension, such
as `splinterd.toml`). For examples, see
[splinterd/packaging/splinterd.toml.example](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter/blob/0-4/splinterd/packaging/splinterd.toml.example)
and
[splinterd/sample_configs](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter/tree/0-4/splinterd/sample_configs)
in the `splinter` repository.

**Connection Types**

The Splinter daemon supports transport-level connections with raw (TCP),
Transport Layer Security (TLS), and WebSocket protocols, which are also called
"transport types". A node can use multiple transport types at once. By default,
`splinterd` configures all transport types. If the `--no-tls` flag is set, no
TLS connections are configured.


TLS requires certificate authority (CA) certificates and keys, which are stored
in `/etc/splinter/certs/` by default. If necessary, you can change the
directory, specify individual file paths and names, or use self-signed
(insecure) certificates in a development environment. For more information, see
the certificate-related options and CERTIFICATE FILES, below.

**Directory Locations**

This command includes several options that change default Splinter directory
locations. These directory locations can also be changed with environment
variables or settings in the `splinterd` TOML configuration file. For more
information, see `--config-dir`, `--storage` `--tls-cert-dir`, and
"SPLINTER DIRECTORY PATHS", below.

FLAGS
=====

`--enable-biome`
: Enable the Biome subsystem, which provides user management functions for
  Splinter applications. The `--database` option is required when this flag is
  used.

`-h`, `--help`
: Prints help information.

`--no-tls`
: Turns off TLS configuration and restricts `splinterd` to TCP (`raw`)
  connections. This flag allows `splinterd` to start without the certificates
  and keys that TLS requires. Without `--no-tls`, if `splinterd` cannot find the
  certificates and keys required by TLS, it exits with an error.

`--tls-insecure`
: Turns off certificate authority validation for TLS connections; all peer
  certificates are accepted. This flag is intended for development environments
  using self-signed certificates.

`-V`, `--version`
: Prints version information.

`-v`
: Increases verbosity. Specify multiple times for more output.

OPTIONS
=======

`--admin-timeout TIMEOUT`
: Sets the coordinator timeout, in seconds, for admin service proposals.
  (Default: 30 seconds.)

  This setting affects consensus-related activities for pending circuit changes
  (functions that use the two-phase commit agreement protocol in the Scabbard
  service).

`--advertised-endpoints` `ADVERTISED-ENDPOINT`
: Specifies the public network endpoint for daemon-to-daemon communication
  between Splinter nodes, if the network endpoint is not public. Use the format
  `tcp://ip:port`. (Default: Same as the network endpoint; see
  `-n`, `--network-endpoints`.)

  Specify multiple endpoints in a comma-separated list or with separate
  `--advertised-endpoint` options.

`-c`, `--config` `CONFIG-FILE`
: Specifies the path and file name for a `splinterd` configuration file, which
  is a TOML file that contains `splinterd` settings. (The file name must end
  with a `.toml` extension.) For examples, see
  [splinterd/packaging/splinterd.toml.example](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter/blob/0-4/splinterd/packaging/splinterd.toml.example)
  and
  [splinter/splinterd/sample_configs](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter/tree/0-4/splinterd/sample_configs)
  in the `splinter` repository.

  Any options on the command line will override the settings in the
  configuration file.

`--config-dir CONFIG-DIR`
: Specifies the directory containing Splinter configuration files. (Default:
  `/etc/splinter`, unless `SPLINTER_CONFIG_DIR` or `SPLINTER_HOME` is set.)

`--display-name DISPLAY-NAME`
: Specifies a human-readable name for the node (Default: "Node NODE-ID")

`--database DB-URL`
: Specifies the URL for the PostgreSQL database used for Biome. (Default:
  127.0.0.1:5432.) This option is required when `--enable-biome` is used.

`--heartbeat SECONDS`
: Specifies how often, in seconds, to send a heartbeat. (Default: 30 seconds.)
  Use 0 to turn off the heartbeat.

  This heartbeat is used to check the health of connections to other Splinter
  nodes.

`-n`, `--network-endpoints` `NETWORK-ENDPOINT`
: Specifies the endpoint for daemon-to-daemon communication between Splinter
  nodes, using the format `protocol_prefix://ip:port`.
  (Default: tcps://127.0.0.1:8044.)

  Specify multiple endpoints in a comma-separated list or with separate
  `-n` or `--network-endpoint` options.

  `--node-id NODE-ID`
: (Required) Sets a new ID for the node. The node ID must be unique across the
  network (for all Splinter nodes that could participate on the same circuit).

`--peers PEER-URL` `[,...]`
: Specifies one or more Splinter nodes that `splinterd` will automatically
  connect to when it starts. The *PEER-URL* argument must specify another node's
  network endpoint, using the format `protocol_prefix://ip:port`.

  Specify multiple nodes in a comma-separated list or by repeating the
  `--peers` option. The protocol prefix part of the peer URL specifies the
  type of connection that is created.

`--registries REGISTRY-FILE` `[,...]`
: Specifies one or more read-only Splinter registry files.

`--registry-auto-refresh SECONDS`
: Specifies how often, in seconds, to fetch remote node registry changes in the
  background. (Default: 600 seconds.) Use 0 to turn off automatic refreshes.

`--registry-forced-refresh SECONDS`
: Specifies how often, in seconds, to fetch remote node registry changes on
  read. (Default: 10 seconds.) Use 0 to turn off forced refreshes.

`--rest-api-endpoint REST-API-ENDPOINT`
: Specifies the connection endpoint for the REST API. (Default: 127.0.0.1:8080.)

`--state-dir STATE-DIR`
: Specifies the storage directory.
  (Default: `/var/lib/splinter`.)

  This option overrides the `SPLINTER_STATE_DIR` environment variable, if set.

`--storage STORAGE-TYPE`
: Specifies whether to store circuit state in memory or in a local YAML file.
  *STORAGE-TYPE* can be `memory` or `yaml` (the default). For `yaml`, the file
  is stored in the default state directory, `/var/lib/splinter`, unless
  `SPLINTER_STATE_DIR` or `SPLINTER_HOME` is set.

  Using `memory` for storage means that circuits will not persist when
  `splinterd` restarts.

`--tls-ca-file CERT-FILE`
: Specifies the path and file name for the trusted CA certificate.
  (Default: `/etc/splinter/certs/ca_pem`.)

  Do not use this option with the `--tls-insecure` flag.

`--tls-cert-dir CERT-DIR`
: Specifies the directory that contains the trusted CA certificates and
  associated key files. (Default: `/etc/splinter/certs/`, unless
  `SPLINTER_CERT_DIR` or `SPLINTER_HOME` is set).

`--tls-client-cert CERT-FILE`
: Specifies the path and file name for the client certificate, which is
  used by `splinterd` when it is sending messages over TLS. (Default:
  `/etc/splinter/certs/client.crt`.)

`--tls-client-key CLIENT-KEY`
: Specifies the path and file name for the client key.
  (Default: `/etc/splinter/certs/client.key`.)

`--tls-server-cert SERVER-CERT`
: Specifies the path and file name for the server certificate, which is used by
  `splinterd` when it is receiving messages over TLS.
  (Default: `/etc/splinter/certs/server.crt`.)

`--tls-server-key SERVER-KEY`
: Specifies the path and file name for the server key.
  (Default: `/etc/splinter/certs/server.key`.)

`--whitelist WHITELIST` `[,...]`
: Lists one or more trusted domains for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
  This option allows the specified domains to access restricted web resources
  in a Splinter application.  If this option is not specified, all domains will
  be allowed to access Splinter web resources.

  Specify multiple domains in a comma-separated list or with separate
  `--whitelist` options.

CERTIFICATE FILES
=================

When the Splinter daemon runs in TLS mode (using `tcps` connections at the
transport layer), it requires certificate authority (CA) certificates and
associated keys that are stored in `/etc/splinter/certs/` by default
(or `$SPLINTER_HOME/certs` if that environment variable is set).

You can change the certificate directory by using the `--tls-cert-dir` option,
setting the `SPLINTER_CERT_DIR` environment variable, or specifying the
location in a `splinterd` configuration file.

By default, the following file names are used for the certificates and
associated keys:

* `ca.pem`
* `client.crt`
* `client.key`
* `server.crt`
* `server.key`

You can specify different paths and file names with the `--tls-ca-file`,
`--tls-client-cert`, `--tls-client-key`, `--tls-server-cert`, and
`--tls-server-key` options (or related settings in the configuration file).

In a development environment, you can use the `--tls-insecure` flag to use
self-signed certificates and keys (which can be generated by the
`splinter cert generate` command). For more information, see
"[Generating Insecure Certificates for
Development](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter-docs/blob/master/docs/howto/generating_insecure_certificates_for_development.md)"
in the Splinter documentation.

SPLINTER DIRECTORY PATHS
========================

Several Splinter directories have the following default locations:

* Splinter configuration directory: `/etc/splinter`

* State directory: `/var/lib/splinter/`

* TLS certificate directory: `/etc/splinter/certs/`

For the configuration and certificate directories, the directory paths can be
changed individually with a `splinterd` option, a setting in a TOML config file,
or an environment variable. (The state directory location is controlled only by
an environment variable when the default YAML storage type is used; no config
setting or command option is available.) For more information, see
`--config-dir`, `--storage` and `--tls-cert-dir`.

In addition, the `SPLINTER_HOME` environment variable provides a simple way to
change the base path for all of these directories. This variable is intended for
development and testing. When `SPLINTER_HOME` is set, the default directory
paths are:

* Splinter configuration directory: `$SPLINTER_HOME/etc/`

* State directory: `$SPLINTER_HOME/data/`

* TLS certificate directory: `$SPLINTER_HOME/certs/`

For example, if `SPLINTER_HOME` is set to `/tmp/testing`, the default path for
the Splinter state directory is `/tmp/testing/data/`.

Note: If an individual environment variable is set, it overrides the value in
`SPLINTER_HOME` (if also set) for that directory. For example, `SPLINTER_HOME`
is set to `/tmp/testing` and `SPLINTER_STATE_DIR` is set to
`/tmp/splinter/state`, the Splinter state directory is `/tmp/splinter/state`.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================

**SPLINTER_CERT_DIR**
: Specifies the directory containing certificate and associated key files.
  (See `--tls-cert-dir`.)

**SPLINTER_CONFIG_DIR**
: Specifies the directory containing configuration files.
  (See: `--config-dir`.)

**SPLINTER_HOME**
: Changes the base directory path for the Splinter directories, including the
  certificate directory. See the "SPLINTER DIRECTORY PATHS" for more
  information.

  This value is not used if an environment variable for a specific directory
  is set (`SPLINTER_CERT_DIR`, `SPLINTER_CONFIG_DIR`, or `SPLINTER_STATE_DIR`).

**SPLINTER_STATE_DIR**
: Specifies where to store the circuit state YAML file, if `--storage` is
  set to `yaml`. (See `--storage`.) By default, this file is stored in
  `/var/lib/splinter`.

**SPLINTER_STRICT_REF_COUNT**
: Turns on strict peer reference counting. If `SPLINTER_STRICT_REF_COUNT`is set
  to `true` and the peer manager tries to remove a peer reference that does not
  exist, the Splinter daemon will panic. By default, the daemon does not panic
  and instead logs an error. This environment variable is intended for
  development and testing.

FILES
=====

`/etc/splinter/`
: Default location for the Splinter configuration directory. Note: If
  `$SPLINTER_HOME` is set, the default location is `$SPLINTER_HOME/etc/`.

`/etc/splinter/certs/`
: Default location for the TLS certificate directory, which stores CA
  certificates and the associated keys. Note: If `SPLINTER_HOME` is set, the
  default location is `$SPLINTER_HOME/certs/`.

`/var/lib/splinter/`
: Default location for the Splinter state directory, which stores the circuit
  state YAML file (unless `--storage` is set to `memory`). Note: If
  `$SPLINTER_HOME` is set, the default location is `$SPLINTER_HOME/data/`.

EXAMPLES
========

To run `splinterd` using the default settings, specify a new, unique node ID.
Replace the example value with the ID for your node.

```
$ splinterd --node-id mynode
```

To specify a configuration file instead of command-line options, use the
`-c` or `--config` option.

```
$ splinterd --config ./configs/splinterd-mynode.toml
```

In this example, the configuration file specifies the node ID and increases
the heartbeat interval to 60 seconds.

```
# Friendly identifier for this node. Must be unique on the network.
node_id = "mynode"

# The number of seconds between network keep-alive heartbeat messages.
# Setting heartbeat to 0 disables this feature.
heartbeat = 60
```
