NAME

**scabbard** â€” Command-line interface for scabbard

SYNOPSIS
========

**scabbard** \[**FLAGS**\] \[**SUBCOMMAND**\]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `scabbard` utility is the command-line interface for scabbard, a Splinter
service that runs Sawtooth Sabre smart contracts on Hyperledger Transact. This
CLI is a convenient tool for uploading, viewing, and executing smart contracts.

* Run `scabbard *SUBCOMMAND* --help` to see information about a specific
  subcommand (for example, `scabbard contract upload --help`).

* To view the man page for a scabbard subcommand, use the "dashed form" of the
  name, where each space is replaced with a hyphen. For example, run
  `man scabbard-contract-show` to see the man page for `scabbard contract show`.
