**scabbard-cr-update** â€” Updates the owners of a Sabre contract registry.

SYNOPSIS
========

**scabbard cr update** \[**FLAGS**\] \[**OPTIONS**\] NAME

DESCRIPTION
===========
This command allows users to update the owners of an existing Sabre contract
registry in state for the targeted scabbard service. All of the existing owners
will be replaced by the owners provided with this command.

FLAGS
=====
`-h`, `--help`
: Prints help information.

`-v`
: Increases verbosity. Specify multiple times for more output.

OPTIONS
=======
`-k`, `--key` FILE
: Indicates the key file to use for signing scabbard transactions. The `FILE`
  can be a relative or absolute file path, or it can be the name of a .priv file
  in the `$HOME/.splinter/keys` directory. The target file must contain a valid
  secp256k1 private key. This option is required.

`-O`, `--owners` KEY
: Includes the given public keys as owners of the contract registry. The
  contract registry must have one or more owners.

`--service-id` ID
: Specifies the fully-qualified service ID of the targeted scabbard service,
  using the format `CIRCUIT_ID::SERVICE_ID`. This option is required.

`-U`, `--url` URL
: Specifies the URL for the `splinterd` REST API that is running the targeted
  scabbard service. (default `http://localhost:8080`) This option is required.

`--wait` SECONDS
: If provided, waits the given number of seconds for the batch to commit.
  Displays an error message if the batch does not commit in time.

ARGUMENTS
=========
`NAME`
: Provides the name of the contract registry to update.

EXAMPLES
========
The following command updates the owners of the `xo` contract registry for a
scabbard service on circuit `01234-ABCDE` with service ID `abcd`, running on the
node with the REST API endpoint `http://localhost:8088`. The contract registry
will be updated to have just one owner, and the transaction will be signed with
the key located in the file `~/user.priv`.

```
$ scabbard cr update \
  --url http://localhost:8088 \
  --service-id 01234-ABCDE::abcd \
  --key ~/user.priv \
  --owner 0385d50a3512f1ef324c9fc86798998d4e3ad2a4e189ceb9ca49aacdcad30a595a \
  xo
```

The next command updates the owners of the `intkey_multiply` contract registry
for the same scabbard service, but includes multiple owners and specifies a key
in the `$HOME/.splinter/keys` directory by name. It also waits up to 10 seconds
for the contract registry update batch to commit.

```
$ scabbard cr update \
  --url http://localhost:8088 \
  --service-id 01234-ABCDE::abcd \
  --key user \
  --owner 0385d50a3512f1ef324c9fc86798998d4e3ad2a4e189ceb9ca49aacdcad30a595a \
  --owner 7b6c889058c2d22558ead2c61b321634b74e705c42f890e6b7bc2c80abb4713118 \
  --owner 02381b606ac2bbe3bd374654cb7cb467ffb0225eb46038a5ec37b43e0c2f085dcb \
  --wait 10 \
  intkey_multiply
```
